# Who am I?
I'm a Sr. SRE who loves automation, and digging into topics around efficiency and reliablity.

## My rules
I have 4 rules:
1. Don't be a monkey.
2. There's no such thing as a 15 minute task.
3. There's no such thing as a one-off.
4. Every temporary solution becomes permanent.

# What else?
## Programming Lanagues
Programming lanauges in no particular order:
* Ruby
* GoLang
* Python
* JavaScript
* Java (meh in)

## Currently Learning
Currently working on learning Terraform and Kubernetes.
